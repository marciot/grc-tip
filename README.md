TIP: Trouble In Paradise
========================

This repository contains the source code of [Trouble in Paradise],
a diagnostic and repair tool for Iomega Zip and Jaz Drives.

The source code in the "x86-asm-source" directory is the original source
code as graciously provided to me by Steve Gibson. I am republishing his
code in this repository with his permission.

This repository will also eventually contain a port of the code intended
to run on classic Macintosh computers.
